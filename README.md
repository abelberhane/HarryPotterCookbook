# Harry Potter Recipe & Potion Cookbook
C# Windows Form Application that allows you to Add and Modify entries to the theme of Harry Potter. The cookbook allows you to view lists of all the potions
available and their ingredients. You also have the ability to add new Recipes and their ingredients. This was my first attempt at working with 
databases and connecting to SQL outside of work. I also implemented the Sound player to add the Harry Potter theme and it really brought the app
together. 

I plan on adding further exception handling and refactoring some of my code the next time I open this back up.
