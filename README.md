# Harry Potter Recipe & Potion Cookbook

C# Windows Form Application that allows you to Add and Modify entries in a database to the theme of Harry Potter. The cookbook allows you to view lists of all the potions available and their ingredients. The app has the ability to update the name of the recipe if you would like. You also have the ability to add new Recipes and their ingredients. 

This was my first attempt at working with databases. I created the database and tables first in Visual Studio/SQL Server. I then connected everything to app and tested things out before progressing. I am looking forward to working on another app that utilizes similar connection methods.

I also implemented the Sound player to add the Harry Potter theme playing throughout. I just needed to add the right using statement and it was a matter of calling it and pressing play. 

I plan on adding further exception handling, adding a delete recipe functionality and refactoring some of my code the next time I open this back up.

I have begun working on the Delete button in my spare time today. Also reviewing my Model in regards to implementing a New Project that requires similar Connection String Methods for next week. Developing early plans for a Movie Film Database that allows the User to log New Movies they would like to see and Retrieve their lists in categories.
